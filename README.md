I am using this repository primarily to follow along with the #rstats community's Tidy Tuesday project (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

## Most recent visualizations

These are a couple visualizations that I made from tidytuesday 2021-8-10, which provided data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on US infrastructure investment. See more and a description [here!](https://github.com/hughesan/connectr/blob/main/tidytuesday/2021-8-10/2021-8-10_BEA.md)
